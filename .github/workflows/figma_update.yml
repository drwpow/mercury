            `Beep boop!` A robot found some updates in Figma to Manifoldâ€™s design system. You may take the following actions:

            - âœ… By **approving and merging** this update, you accept the changes to the design system, and a new version will be released to npm upon merge.
            - ðŸš« By **closing** this PR and **deleting the branch**, nothing will happen (though be warned another PR may be opened up tomorrow; consult with design on the changes made if this was an error or if something is unexpected).
